### Functionality & Logic
* Code solves the intended problem correctly
* Edge cases are handled appropriately
* No obvious bugs or logical errors
* Performance considerations are reasonable for the use case

### Code Clarity & Maintainability
* Functions are single-purpose (and hence reasonably sized)
* Variable and function names clearly express intent and domain concepts
* Code structure follows logical flow without excessive nesting
* Comments explain *why* decisions were made, not *what* the code does
* Complex algorithms reference documentation or have brief rationale
* No unnecessary complexity or over-engineering

### Design & Architecture
* Code follows established patterns in the codebase
* Proper separation of concerns
* Dependencies are reasonable and justified
* No code duplication without good reason

### Testing & Quality Assurance
* Adequate test coverage for new functionality
* Tests are meaningful and test the right things
* All tests pass
* Manual testing completed where appropriate

### Security & Safety
* No sensitive data exposed in logs or responses
* Input validation where needed
* No obvious security vulnerabilities
* Error handling doesn't leak implementation details

### Standards & Consistency
* Code follows team coding standards
* Consistent formatting and style
* No linting errors
* Documentation updated if needed

### Git & Process
* Commit messages are clear and descriptive
* PR description explains the changes and why
* Branch is up to date with target branch
* PR size is reasonable for effective review
